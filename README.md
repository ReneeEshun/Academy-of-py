ACADEMY OF PY OBSERVATIONS ON TRENDS FROM DATA

	In analyzing data from schools, the questions arise whether school size, budget, and type of school have a positive effect on
  students reading and math scores.  The following are a few observations:
•	Students tend to have a higher passing rate in reading over math at both top and bottom performing schools. 
•	The top performing school types were charter schools and the worse performing type of schools were district schools. 
•	School size does matter. The smaller and medium school size had a higher overall passing rate in both math and reading over larger 
  schools.
•	To my surprise, the smaller budget per student had higher score percentage in both reading and math than the schools with  higher budget
  per student. Other factors that are not included in this data may be an affect on this data trend such as geographic areas higher salaries, drop out rates, and etc.
