    "\tIn analyzing data from schools, the questions arise whether school size, budget, and type of school have a positive or negative effect on students reading and math scores.  The following are a few observations:\n",
    "•\tStudents tend to have a higher passing rate in reading over math at both top and bottom performing schools. \n",
    "•\tThe top performing school types were charter schools and the worse performing type of schools were district schools. \n",
    "•\tSchool size does matter. The smaller and medium school size had a higher overall passing rate in both math and reading over larger schools.\n",
    "•\tTo my surprise, the smaller budget per student had higher score percentage in both reading and math than the schools with  higher budget per student. Other factors that are not included in this data may be an affect on this data trend such as geographic areas with higher salaries, drop out rates, and etc. \n",
